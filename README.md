**Offline-first HTTP request handling for Flutter applications.**

`sync_offline_requests` ensures your app remains functional even in unreliable network conditions. It automatically queues failed API requests when the device is offline and synchronizes them effectively once internet connectivity is restored, using a persistent SQLite-backed queue.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📡 Offline-First Architecture**: Seamlessly handle HTTP requests regardless of network status.
- **🧾 Persistent Queue**: Requests are safely stored in a local SQLite database, surviving app restarts.
- 🧹 Automatic cleanup of failed requests after retry limit is exceeded
- **🔁 Intelligent Retry**: Configurable retry mechanisms with maximum retry limits for failed sync attempts.
- **🌐 Auto-Synchronization**: Automatically detects network restoration and processes the queue.
- **⏳ FIFO Processing**: Maintains the order of operations with First-In-First-Out processing.
- **🧠 Minimal API**: Simple to integrate with existing projects.

---

## 📦 Installation

Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sync_offline_requests: ^1.0.4
```

Run the fetch command:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize

Initialize the package in your `main()` function. This sets up the database and network listeners.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sync_offline_requests/sync_offline_requests.dart';

void main() {
  
  // Initialize the offline sync engine
  OfflineSync.initialize();
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

### 2. Send Requests

Use `OfflineSync` to send your HTTP requests. The package handles the rest.

```dart
try {
  await OfflineSync.post(
    url: 'https://example.com/api/data',
    body: {
      'name': 'John Doe',
      'role': 'Developer',
    },
  );
  print('Request processed (either sent or queued)');
} catch (e) {
  print('Error processing request: $e');
}
```

**Behavior:**
- **Online**: The request is sent immediately.
- **Offline**: The request is saved to the local database and queued for later synchronization.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

1.  **Storage**: All requests are initially passed to the `OfflineSync` handler.
2.  **Queue**: If offline, the request is stored in SQLite.
3.  **Monitoring**: The package listens for connectivity changes (Wi-Fi, Mobile Data).
4.  **Sync**: When a connection is re-established, the queue is processed.
5.  **Retry Logic**: Failed sync attempts are retried up to a configurable limit before being discarded to prevent infinite loops.

### Retry & Cleanup Strategy

- Each request has a retry counter
- Failed sync attempts increment the retry count
- Once the retry limit is exceeded:
  - The request is marked as failed
  - It can be safely removed using `clearFailedOnly()`
  - This prevents infinite retry loops and battery drain

---

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Manual Sync

You can force a sync operation manually, for example, on a "Pull to Refresh" action.

```dart
await OfflineSync.syncNow();
```

### Check Pending Requests

Get the current count of requests waiting in the queue.

```dart
final int pendingCount = await OfflineSync.pendingCount();
print('Pending requests: $pendingCount');
```

## 🧹 Failed Request Cleanup

To prevent infinite retries and database growth, requests that exceed the
maximum retry limit are considered **failed**.

You can manually remove such requests using:

```dart
final removedCount = await OfflineSync.clearFailedOnly();
print('Removed $removedCount failed requests');
```

This helps keep local storage clean and avoids unnecessary sync attempts.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Currently supports **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** methods.
- Designed primarily for **JSON** payloads.
- Not optimized for large multi-part file uploads.
- Background sync (when the app is closed) is platform-dependent and currently relies on the app being in the foreground or suspended state.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] GET request caching support
- [ ] Custom headers configuration
- [ ] Enhanced background sync work manager
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Payload encryption
